# Kraina

## Overview

- Government: Parliament
- Capital: [Milwood](./milwood.md)
- Major Cities:
  - [Nasol](nasol.md)
- Features a mostly rural and seafaring population.
  - Milwood is a fishing villiage where each parliament member goes to meet once every 3 moons.
  - Though spread out, the different factions within Kraina are fiercly loyal to one another, and to any they deem to be allies
    - Attacking one faction will often result in bringing the wrath of half of the country upon you within days.  It is speculated that the experienced Krainan Tunnel Guides use a secret set of tunnels to allow their faction to traverse the nation more quickly than is normally possible in such cases.

## The Tunnels

- While Kraina has traditional road systems, the frigid tundra makes travel dangerous at many times of the year. To help combat this, the Krainans have constructed tens of thousands of miles under the earth.  Having been placed over the course of centuries, many of the oldest tunnels remain lost to time or in disrepair, but they are typically much safer and quicker to traverse assuming that you know your path or have a Krainan Tunnel Guide, as going off path can prove to be fatal.
- Each settlement will have an entrance to the tunnels, with many others hidden throughout the land
