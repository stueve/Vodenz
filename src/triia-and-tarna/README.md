# Triia and Tarna

## Overview

- Government: Magocracy

Triia and Tarna house the largest, and easily most prestigious mage college in all of Vodenz. It is also the oldest, being over 2000 years old.  For most who want to train to use magic, the college is considered the best option in order to maximize their inate skills. It is estimated that around two thirds of all schooled mages in Vodenz attended the college at some point, a percentage that has continued to rise in recent years, in part due to the iron grip that the college has on modern magical knowledge, as well as their increase in the taxes on exported magic items, making it difficult to finantially support a college elsewhere.

Upon graduation, all mages are required to spend 5 years in service to the cities. This service is often done by assisting around the college, but new graduates are also commonly used as mercenary mages by other nations should war arise.  If a mage deserts during this 5-year period, the penalty is death, and the college will publicly put a large bounty on their head.

## International Relations

Triia and Tarna is publicly neutral with all of the nations in Vodenz, and suggests that they do the same, should they ever wish for help from the colleges.

There are a few exceptions to the above rule:

> __Kraina__ is hostile to Triia and Tarna after the college was caught taking artifacts from Krainan relic sites, which the Krainans hold sacred.  After which Kraina has started housing and defending college runaways, while disallowing any current members to enter.

> The college is forbidden from entering an __Independant Dwarven City__ due to numerous conflicts between the two in the past, though the college's official declaration is they are neutral to the States.
