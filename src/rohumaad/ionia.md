# Ionia

Third largest city in Rohumaad, with the largest intranational port and trade market. If a good is produced in Rohumaad, it can be found somewhere in Ionia.

Ionia is also a common stopping point for travelers on their way to the southern portion of [The Spine](../geo/the-spine.md). Many of Rohumaad's guilds are based out of Ionia, as it's central location and heavy travel allows for consistant business opportunites.

Ionia also boasts the largest capital building in the nation, and is the location where much of the government resides during the cold months, when international trade in [Locria](./locria.md) slows.
