## Overview

- Government: League of States
- Capital: [Port Laza](port-laza.md)
- Major Cities
  - [Pacca](pacca.md)

The Island of Laza is home to a small collection of nations: the _West Laza Collective_, the _Khu'zai_, and the _Mountain State_. While they often opperate separate from one another, they all opperate under the Lazan Government.

Laza is home to the largest college for non-magical studies in Vodenz, with many scholars, explorers, and wilderness experts doing their studies in the Mountain Colleges.  

The island is especially unique for being the most biodiverse land within Vodenz, with more unique flora and fauna on the island than the rest of the nations combined.

## International Relations

- __Allies__
  - [Doria](../doria/README.md)
    - Because much of laza is forrested, they lack significant landspace to grow grains, which they import heavily from Doria.
    - Doria has been the primary supporter in helping to fight of _The Scourge_, having especially good ties to Khut'ri, who houses a large garrison of Dorian Troops.
  - [Kraina](../kraina/README.md)
    - Many of the Krainan Tunnel Guides spend years in Laza to learn tracking and navigation.
    - Laza helped Kraina with a blight of their own 90 years prior, and Kraina has been sending supplies and manpower to help fight the scourge.
