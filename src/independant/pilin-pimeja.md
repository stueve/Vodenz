# Pilin Pimeja

Pilin Pimeja is a member of the Independant Dwarven States.

The outpost is a checkpoint for anyone who wishes to travel between Rohumaad and Doria through the Southern half of [The Spine](../geo/the-spine.md). Travelers may also request a guide if they wish to travel through the tunnels to [Crafsal](./crafsal.md) in the North.

Pilin Pimeja has recently begun testing alchemical mining techniques, which has led to some complaints from cities along [Lake Helvid](../doria/lake-helvid.md), who are worried about it effecting the fishing in the lake.
