- [Thuingg](independant/thuingg.md)

The Dwarven Independant States are a collection of dwarven citystates that are located within various mountain ranges across Vodenz. The cities are loosly allied, though they opperate separately from one another.

## Morath

- [Morath](independant/morath.md)

Morath is a largly-elven settlement located near the center of the [Morathian Forest](../doria/morathian-forest.md). While it largly retains neutrality with the majority of the nations of Vodenz, it has a tense relationship with Doria, and it forbids any groups of more than 100 soldiers from entering the city. This rule was set in place during the recent conflict between Doria and Syre which resulted in the annexation of the forest by Doria.  The elves also require that they oversee any logging opperations within the forest, and forbid a large portion of the forest from being used for lumber.

Most travelers who go through the forest are allowed to stay within morath, with druids and researchers being given free lodging by the city.  Also, any civilians that wish to travel through the forest may request a Morathian escort to allow them to safely traverse the forest.

## Freyview

- [Freyview](independant/freyview.md)

Freyview is often seen as the unofficial Northernmost clan within Kraina.  While they are not part of the Krainan Collective and as such do not have a say in any official policies within Kraina, they are closely allied with the nation and have often gone to defend Kraina when it has been attacked in the past.

The city holds many of the same relationships with the other nations as Kraina, but maintains a closer relationship with [Astria](../astria/README.md), especially the monks at [Marnall](../astria/marnall.md), who permit Freyview citizens to stay within the city, in exchange for resources such as oil from the large-game hunting that Freyview is known for.
