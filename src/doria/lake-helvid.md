# Lake Helvid

## Overview

Lake Helvid is located in Western Doria in-between [The Spine] and [Helvidale](helvidale.md). It is the deepest lake in Doria (the exact depth is still unknown as noone who has attempted to reach the bottom has done so successfully), and has always been a location in which researchers, scientists, and druids have gathered.
