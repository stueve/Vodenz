# North Helvid

## Overview

North Helvid is the first major stop after exiting the spine through [Pilin Pimeja], and is the location in Vodenz where the highest percentage of dwarves live.

Trade and fishing encompass much of their economy, with some crops grown near the river, as far from the river it is too arid to grow

## Dwarven Presence

- North Helvid has an excellent relationship with Pilin Pimeja and [Crafsal], and has a long-standing tradition of siding with the Dwarven empire on issues, which has caused conflict with [Doria](README.md) in the past.  
  - This positive relationship extends to Helvidale, which will send envoys to North Helvid on Parliament Day, where North Helvid and The Dwarven Empire discuss matters.
