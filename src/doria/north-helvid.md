# North Helvid

## Overview

North Helvid is the first major stop after exiting the spine through [Pilin Pimeja](../independant/pilin-pimeja.md), and is the location in Vodenz where the highest percentage of dwarves live.

Trade and fishing encompass much of their economy, with some crops grown near the river, as far from the river it is too arid to grow

## Dwarven Presence

- North Helvid has an excellent relationship with [Pilin Pimeja](../independant/pilin-pimeja.md) and [Crafsal](../independant/crafsal.md), and has a long-standing tradition of siding with the Dwarven empire on issues, which has caused conflict with [Doria](README.md) in the past.  
  - This positive relationship extends to Helvidale, which will send envoys to North Helvid on Parliament Day, where North Helvid and The Dwarven Empire discuss matters.

### North Helvid Flood

The explosion that occured in the spine caused a surge in the river that resulted in a large amount of flooding in North Helvid.  As of the current time, around 30 people are missing and close to 20 percent of the city has been damaged.

While looking around the town, the PC's noticed that there have been many cases of small shards of a purple crystal being found around the river that appear to have been deposited along the river by the rubble that was moving downstream. No one seems to know what kind of gem it is.

PC's talked to one of the University researchers that has been working in North Helvid, she let them know that one of the researchers is missing, but from what she has seen/heard it appears as if the dwarven miners from Pilin Pimeja were using new Alchemical bombs that ended up getting out of control, and when they opened up a cavern with a lava flow it ignited the remaining cache, which caused an uncontrolled explosion that resulted in the landslide that caused the flooding. Upon further inspection of the cavern, it looks to have been manmade, though no team had begun to explore it as of the time when teams were sent to help North Helvid.
