# Vodenz

_Note: Currently a work in progress, I am compiling all of my notes / filling out some areas of the world at the moment_

Welcome! Vodenz is a world that I have been building out for a bit now, and finally decided to put it up on github. I am currently using it for TTRPG's, but you are welcome to use/modify any of the information that you see here for your own purposes!

The only information that I currently am displaying here is information that is initially available to PC's, so there will likely be large gaps in knowledge / empty pages.  If you would like to know more about something that is missing, let me know!
