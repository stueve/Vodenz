# Vodenz

Welcome! Vodenz is a world that I have been building out for a bit now, and finally decided to put it up on github. I am currently using it for TTRPG's, but you are welcome to use/modify any of the information that you see here for your own purposes!

Currently I am attempting to add and organize any notes that I have written over the world in the past.  There will likely be incomplete/missing sections, and some may be vague as to not spoil potential plots for any players I GM. If you would like any additional information/clarifications, please let me know!
