# The Maw

Also known as _The Maw of Hell_.

Extremely deep canyon, much of the bottom of which has yet to be completely explored. Those who have explored deep within the canyon say that the bottom has a strong magical aura, and some parties that have ventured deeper swear that they were being watched, though they cannot say by what.
