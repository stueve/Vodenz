# Eastport

Eastport is the capital and largest city in the arid country of Syre. Located at the Southeastern-most point in mainland Vodenz, Eastport is a common stopover point for Vessels rounding the island, as well as a place where a large portion of the steel exports in Vodenz take place.

North of Eastport is the Desert Road, the only heavily traveled road in Syre, which heads towards Steelspike in the North. The now unmaintained Morathian Road goes West towards a tunnel in the mountains that leads into Doria, though the road is considered dangerous since it became unmaintained and unprotected since the loss of the Morathian Forest 38 years prior.
