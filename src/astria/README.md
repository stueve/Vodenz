- Entry into Astria is forbidden without approval from _The Shipyard_ or an immediate member of the royal family.

## Flora and Fauna

- The flora and fauna are the least studied from any on [Vodenz](../vodenz.md), mostly due to travel restrictions
- Only recently were any outsiders allowed in to study the Southern forest
  - Research has shown it to be older than any forests on the mainland
- Many scholars speculate that the _Darkwood_ is even more ancient than the Southern forest, but this has yet to be proven with any definitive evidence.
