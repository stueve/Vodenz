# The Darkwood

Ancient forest in the North of Astria. Very little is known about the forest, as access is strictly forbidden, and there are incredibly strong wards which make it near impossible to enter via the Grey Ocean.  It is rumored that the Astrians made deals with demons to help protect the forest.
