# Azel

They are an omnipotent being who is seen as the progenitor of creation.  

Azel is the parent of the [Ael](./ael/the-ael.md), whom they created to be the shapers and caretakers of [Vodenz](../vodenz.md).  

The [Nyl](./nyl/the-nyl.md) were created after, as the creators of life on the earth.

The legends say that Azel looked over the world as its protector until [The God's War](./godwar.md), where Azel sacrificed themselves to save Vodenz, with their corpse falling to earth.  Earth was thrown into the air, falling around their body. Over time their bones fused with the earth, creating [The Spine of Azel](../geo/the-spine.md), along with numerous other landmarks throughout Vodenz.
