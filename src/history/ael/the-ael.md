# The Ael and Ael'hi

## The Ael (The Ancient Gods)

The _Ael_ were the three original children of Azel. They are the gods of the elements, and shaped the foundations of Vodenz upon which life may exist. The Ael are long gone since their war with the [Nyl](../nyl/the-nyl.md), so the stories say, but their raw power can still often be felt to this day.

## The Ael'hi

The Ael'hi were the God-servants or demi-gods, each of whom serves a specific one of the Ael.  They are linked to their Ael, and serve as the god's messenger to the people of [Vodenz](../../vodenz.md).

### Appearance

While they supposedly could manifest as a humanoid, Ael'hi often took the appearance of a powerful animal native to the domain of their Ael.
